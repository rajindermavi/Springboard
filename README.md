# **Springboard**

This repository contains the hand's on training activities from Springboard's extensive Machine Learning program. The CodeAlongs folder contains informal exercises in methods ranging from KNN classifiers to TensorFlow nlp processing and text generation. The MiniProjects folders are a collection of problem solving exercises on topics from anomoly detection to recommendation systems.


### MiniProjects:
